<h1>CS Thrift API</h1>
<h2>What's CS Thift API?</h2>

The API provides communication between the core CREDITS platform and third-party services based on Apache technology. Thrift is an interface description language that is used to define and create services for different programming languages. It is a framework for remote procedure calls (RPCs). Used as a scalable cross-language development service. It combines a software pipeline with a code generation engine to develop services that are more or less efficient and easy to use between languages ​​such as C #, C ++, Delphi, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and JavaScript, etc. In other words, Thrift is a binary communication protocol.
